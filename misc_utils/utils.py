def create_virtual_folder(src_folder, virtual_folder):
    '''
    Creates a "virtual folder" by creating symbolic links for each file in the source folder (src_folder) to the 
    destination folder (virtual_folder). This function will walk through the directory tree of the source folder 
    and generate symlinks for all files, skipping files like .DS_Store. It will log the creation of each symlink, 
    as well as skipping already existing symlinks.

    Arguments:
        src_folder (str): The path to the source folder whose files need to be linked. This can be any directory on the 
        filesystem.
        virtual_folder (str): The path to the destination folder where the symlinks will be created. This folder will be 
        created if it doesnâ€™t exist.

    Returns:
        List of strings: A list of log messages indicating the actions performed. Each log message will either note the 
        creation of a new symlink or the skipping of an existing symlink.
